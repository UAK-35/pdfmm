/** PdfStreamedDocument is the preferred class for
 *  creating new PDF documents.
 *
 *  Page contents, fonts and images are written to disk
 *  as soon as possible and are not kept in memory.
 *  This results in faster document generation and
 *  less memory being used.
 *
 *  Please use PdfMemDocument if you intend to work
 *  on the object structure of a PDF file.
 *
 *  One of the design goals of PdfStreamedDocument was
 *  to hide the underlying object structure of a PDF
 *  file as far as possible.
 *
 *  \see PdfDocument
 *  \see PdfMemDocument
 *
 *  Example of using PdfStreamedDocument:
 *
 *  PdfStreamedDocument document("outputfile.pdf");
 *  PdfPage* page = document.CreatePage(PdfPage::CreateStandardPageSize(PdfPageSize::A4));
 *  PdfFont* font = document.CreateFont("Arial");
 *
 *  PdfPainter painter;
 *  painter.SetPage(page);
 *  painter.SetFont(font);
 *  painter.DrawText(56.69, page->GetRect().GetHeight() - 56.69, "Hello World!");
 *  painter.FinishPage();
 *
 *  document.Close();
